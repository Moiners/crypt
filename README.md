# Crypt

### generalinfo
This program uses symmetric encryption, which means the same key it used to encrypt data, is also usable for decryption.
The library it uses is built on top of AES algorithm.
A key is stored in the "key.key" file, which can be renewed at any time.
In the program it can be decided whether the key in the file should be used or whether one would like to use a user-defined one. 

### setup
To use the program properly, cryptography must be installed.
You can install it by running
"pip3 install cryptography" or
"pip install cryptography" in the console.
Also, the file to be encrypted or decrypted must be located in the "data" folder.

### start
After everything is correct, you can start the program by running "start.sh" in a terminal.
